Managing food allergies is a critical concern for individuals and families. Makoon is a smartphone application designed to simplify allergy management using artificial intelligence (AI). The app employs optical character recognition (OCR) to scan product ingredient labels, instantly notifying users if any listed components match their documented allergy profiles.

To enhance detection accuracy, word embeddings are utilized to identify ingredient synonyms, integrated with a rule-based system for a more comprehensive ingredient analysis. This repository contains the implementation of Release 1, covering the core functionalities:

User registration & allergy profile setup
OCR-powered ingredient scanning
Real-time allergy alerts
Future releases will introduce additional features such as multi-profile support and a safe product list. This project aims to provide a practical, AI-enhanced solution to help individuals make informed food choices and manage allergies effectively.
